  - Change the color of the tower that the user clicked on
  - Helps users see which tower they are on

* Issue 45: Create an Options Button (150 points)
  - Option button will take the user to a window that includes the pause and reset buttons
  - Makes the game GUI more presentable

*Issue 47: Create a post for the tower (50 points)
