#Tower of Hanoi is not a solver, simulation, or an animation. It is a game.
-In order to play the game, input ant run, and in order to run it with the GUI
-run it with ant run-GUI


#User stories for describing current software
1)As a user, I can move the disk to another tower if the disk I am moving is smaller than the disk it is placed on (or if the tower is empty) so that I can shift all of the disks to another tower

2)As a user, I can see the rings move so that I have a visual cue and know how to proceed and continue on with the game.

3)As a user, I get a "Illegal move" message when I make a invalid move so that I can see which moves are allowed.

4)As a user, I can type q when playing the game so that I can quit the game.


#The software does run. To win this game, you must move all of the disks from the first tower to another tower using all three towers, and must not put a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.
-Both games prompt the user to input a value for the number of disks the user would like.
-The ASCII game is played by inputting two integers with a space in between them. So 0 2 would move the top most ring in tower 0 to tower 2.
-The GUI game is played by clicking the two towers, where the first is where the top most disk is taken, and the second is the tower the disk from the first click will go to.


#User stories for things that can be added to make the software more useful/fun
1)As a programmer, I can change the way to move disks by allowing the user to drag and drop the disks instead of clicking the towers.

2)As a programmer, I can add ways to change the way the GUI looks, so that users can change the GUI if needed.

3)As a programmer, I can include a button that allows the user to have a timeout so that the timer does not continue, and resume when the user is ready, so that the user will be able to have an accurate time of how long it took them to win.


#The README.md, provides a good description of both the ASCII and GUI version of the tower of hanoi game in relatively high detail. Also tells the user how torun the game using the ant commands (GUI and ASCII) and provides pictures of each version of the game. Things that we can 
add to the README.md include a QA section with frequently asked questions, a description of what tower of hanoi is for those who have never
seen or played it, and a troubleshooting section that tells the user to input ant clean if the game is not running, and to rerun the game us
ing the launch game commands already given.


#Currently, the build.xml file includes great descriptions of what each target is for (in the message or description). Doesn't seem to miss
anything that causes ambiguity.


#Yes there are plenty of issues we can fix. Multiple options are given to us from past students/TAs, and some we can come up with ourselves.
 Issues are clear in terms of expectations, some of which we thought of ourselves, and they were written in the issues list.

#how the code is organized
-The code is spread throughout multiple directories based off of the purpose of each file/class. So the classes that deal with GUI component
s are all in the utility directory.

#Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear?
-Yes, the purposes of the classes and the methods are well named and well commented to describe what they do.

#Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another?
-No, because they aren't enough comments to specify the relationship but we are able to generalize how they are related because of how the c
lasses are organized.

#Is the code easy to read and understand?
-For the most part, the code is easy to read and understand especially because of the formatting and method names. Comments also contribute 
in clearing ambiguity for what each method/class does.

#If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just "one screenful of text" to help that programmer get up to speed qui
ckly, what information would you convey?
-In cs56-games-towers-of-hanoi/src/edu/ucsb/cs56/projects/games/towers_of_hanoi/model/TowersOfHanoiState.java the TowersOfHanoi class uses A
rrayLists to keep track of the disks in each tower, and uses exception handling for illegal moves such as wrong inputs. This class includes 
a constructor, and an argument constructor, along with private member variables and public member functions (getters). There is a toString m
ethod to draw the disks for the ASCII version of the game. In the model directory, there also includes a TowersOfHanoiStateTest file that te
sts all of the constructions and member functions in TowersOfHanoi class.
-In cs56-games-towers-of-hanoi/src/edu/ucsb/cs56/projects/games/towers_of_hanoi/utility, there are java classes for different components for
 the GUI version of the game.
-In cs56-games-towers-of-hanoi/src/edu/ucsb/cs56/projects/games/towers_of_hanoi/view, there is CmdLineHanoi.java which is a file that allows
 the ASCII game to run using the command line for inputs.

#how is the test coverage?
-For tests, there is only one test that tests the main file, which includes only the core game methods and constructors.

#Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing?
-Yes, there is only one JUnit test, which is TowersOfHanoiStateTest.java, which does what we covered in the previous question.

#Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
-Yes, we can expand the test coverage to test the GUI components, and to do so, we would create a JUnit test in the directory with all of the GUI components and individually test each component, or include these tests into TowersOfHanoiStateTest.java.
