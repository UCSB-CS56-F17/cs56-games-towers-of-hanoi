#A set of user stories about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better.
1. As a player, I can drag and drop the disk so that I know which disk I am moving.
2. As a player, I can see a leaderboard for the shortest time from precedent players so that I am motivated to break the record.

#An assessment of the actual code.
The code is organized in three different directory, one for basic state of the tower named “model”, one for the GUI version of the game named “utility” and one for the ASCII version of the game “named” view.
The class and methods of the TowerOfHanoiState are clear with the comments before each methods. However, in the utilty directory, the methods for the GUI version of the game are not described by comments and required the next programmer to look through the code to find the meaning of the funtion.
Although there is not enough comments to explain the organization of the code, the basic structure of the GUI version of the game is clear.
The code is easy to read and understand if the next programmer figure out the organization of the code.
##“one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly:
model/TowersOfHanoiState.java contains the core of the game including a construtor, using ArrayList<Integer> to store the status of the tower, and methods to move the disks, determine whether the move is legal, determine whether the game is solved, and draw the ASCII version of the game.
model/TowersOfHanoiStateTest.java contains the JUnitTest for the main parts of the game, showing whether the constructor and methods in TowersOfHanoiState.java works properly.
utility/GUIMain.java is the main class to launch the GUI version of the game.
GameGUI.java manage the Timer and the GamePanel.
GamePanel.java draws the towers and disks on each tower, and it also contains buttons to move the disks from tower to tower.
HanoiTimer.java provides a timer class that will begin running as soon as it is created.
HanoiTimerGUI.java draws the GUI for the timer.
view/CmdLineHanoi.java allows the game to run in command-line interface with user input.
#An assessment of the test
The test cover the constructor and methods of TowersOfHanoiState.java which is the main part of the game, using the JUnit test. However, the GUI utility code is not tested. We can create another test to test each component of the GUI utility such as the GamePanel and the HanoiTimer using the Junit test. This will be a new test file, and we need to change the build.xml to make a new target to run this test apart from TowersOfHanoiStateTest.
