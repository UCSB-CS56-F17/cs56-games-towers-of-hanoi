# Legacy code poject improvements proposal - W15
#### Connor Armbrust Mulcaey & Elena Morozova

## Proposals form improving README.md
* Better screenshots (special MAc OS X shadow ones)
* Update screenshots if we updated the interface

## Issues we have with the issues
* What is meant by "It isn't obvious when the player loses the game"
  - How can you even lose the game?

## Issues we are planning to do
* Game over screen - "You completed the game in X moves, the optimal solution was Y moves"
* Replay option (on the game over screen)
* Instructions - "How to play" button
* Visual feedback in the GUI for illegal moves
* Make the GUI interface prettier & easier on the eyes

## Proposed issues/improvements to add
* Validation for the num disks
  - Min of 3
  - NaN error
  - Max of ~25 or something reasonalble
* Num moves counter
* Autoresize the play screen to the window so it fits all the disks without having to drag it to the proper size
* Add arrow key controls
* Set the enter key to click the Play button in the Number of Disks window

## Stuff we already fixed - "low hanging fruit"
* Since JTextField doesn't come with placeholder functionality, we went ahead and added a label to the NumDisks input. Before it came with text inside it that the user had to delete (i.e. the poor man's placeholder).
* We changed the "Done" button to say "Play" instead (more descript)
* We made the text-field autofocused when the Number of Disks window pops up so the user doesn't have to click it
* Fixed heading for Gameplay Instructions in the README
* Fix style for GUI version heading and ASCII Version heading in the README
