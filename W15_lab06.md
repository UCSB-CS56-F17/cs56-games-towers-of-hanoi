# Legacy code poject improvements proposal - W15
#### Connor Armbrust Mulcahey & Elena Morozova

## Proposals form improving README.md
* Update screenshots if we updated the interface

## Existing issues we are planning to tackle
* Game over screen - "You completed the game in X moves, the optimal solution was Y moves"
* Replay option (on the game over screen)
* Instructions - "How to play" button
* Visual feedback in the GUI for illegal moves

## Proposed issues/improvements to add
* Reformat the indentation of most of the files - they are all over the place
* Validation for the num disks
  - Min of 3
  - NaN error
  - Max of ~25 or something reasonable
* Number of moves counter
* Autoresize the play screen to the window so it fits all the disks without having to drag it to the proper size
* Set the enter key to click the Play button in the Number of Disks window
* We see timer buttons being declared and added to the timer panel, but they aren't visible in the panel
* The code is severely lacking in comments
* Make the GUI interface prettier & easier on the eyes
* Add keyboard controls

## Stuff we already fixed - "low hanging fruit"
* Since JTextField doesn't come with placeholder functionality, we went ahead and added a label to the NumDisks input. Before it came with text inside it that the user had to delete (i.e. the poor man's placeholder).
* We changed the "Done" button to say "Play" instead (more descript)
* We made the text-field autofocused when the Number of Disks window pops up so the user doesn't have to click it
* Fixed heading for Gameplay Instructions in the README
* Fix style for GUI version heading and ASCII Version heading in the README
* Fixed painful colors in GUI version of game, updated screenshots accordingly
