* Issue #16 LeaderBoard (200 PTS)

Add a leaderboard.The leaderboard should display the top three times (i.e. shortest times) for each number of
disks,from the most ever solved down to the least, with the name of the person, and the date/time that they got that score.The leaderboard should be saved between runs of the program and should be accessible from the starting menu.
