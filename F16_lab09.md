* Issue #16 LeaderBoard (200 PTS)

Add a leaderboard.The leaderboard should display the top three times (i.e. shortest times) for each number of
disks,from the most ever solved down to the least, with the name of the person, and the date/time that they got that score.The leaderboard should be saved between runs of the program and should be accessible from the starting menu.

* Issue #29 Drag and Drop (200 PTS)

Instead of selecting the towers to move, allow the user to drag and drop the disks from tower to tower.

* Issue #31 Custom graphics (150 PTS)

The latest update allows the color of the blocks and their shapes to be changed. However, more interesting picture-based graphics like the skins used on the rings and pegs, would still be nice.
