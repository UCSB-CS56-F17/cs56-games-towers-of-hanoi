At each step, the game displays an ASCII representation of the current state of the towers.
To move a disk from one tower to another, the user types in the start tower number and the end tower number separated by a space.

The game counts the user's moves. When the user completes the puzzle, the game tells the user how many moves it took him/her, as well as how many moves the optimal solution would have been.
